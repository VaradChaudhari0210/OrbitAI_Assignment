Analyze this college application essay focusing on what admissions officers look for:

**CLARITY (0-100)**: How clear, readable, and well-structured is the writing? Is the narrative easy to follow? Are ideas expressed precisely without confusion or ambiguity?

**TONE (0-100)**: Does the essay sound authentic and reflect the student's genuine voice? Is it confident without being arrogant? Is the tone appropriate for a college application (not too casual, not too stiff)?

**IMPACT (0-100)**: How powerfully does the student communicate their story and ideas? Is it memorable and compelling? Does it showcase unique perspectives, personal growth, or meaningful experiences that make the student stand out?

Provide:
1. Three scores (0-100) for Clarity, Tone, and Impact
2. A brief feedback summary (2-3 sentences) focusing on the essay's effectiveness as a college application essay
3. 3-5 specific, actionable suggestions that will elevate the essay, each with:
   - originalText: An exact quote from the essay (10-30 words)
   - feedback: Specific advice on how to improve it for college admissions (not just grammar fixes, but substantive improvements)
   - category: "Clarity", "Tone", or "Impact"

Focus on helping the student refine their authentic voice while meeting high admissions standards. Look for:
- Showing vs. telling (use specific examples instead of generic statements)
- Unique personal insights and growth
- Authentic voice (not trying to sound impressive, but genuinely reflective)
- Strong narrative structure and flow
- Memorable opening and closing
- Avoiding clich√©s and generic statements
